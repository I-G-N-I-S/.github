# I.G.N.I.S.: Intelligent Fire Detection at the Edge

**I.G.N.I.S.** (Inteligência para Gerenciamento e Neutralização de Incêndios Sistematizada) represents a cutting-edge technological response to one of Brazil's most pressing environmental challenges: the detection and management of forest fires.

## Origins and Purpose

Developed amid rising concerns about the alarming frequency of wildfires across Brazil—particularly devastating events in the Amazon rainforest—I.G.N.I.S. addresses critical gaps in conventional fire detection and monitoring methods. Traditional monitoring approaches, whether human observation or satellite imaging, often identify fires too late for effective intervention or suffer from resolution limitations during critical early stages.

## Technological Foundation

At its core, I.G.N.I.S. leverages advanced computer vision and artificial intelligence through:

- **YOLO Architecture**: Implements a deep learning model for binary classification as a fast solution to identify fire presence.

- **Edge Computing Implementation**: Designed for deployment on ESP32 platforms with optical cameras, enabling real-time processing in remote areas with limited infrastructure

## Environmental and Social Mission

I.G.N.I.S. represents more than technological innovation—it embodies a commitment to environmental preservation and community safety. By detecting fires in their earliest stages when intervention remains most effective, the system:

- Supports proactive rather than reactive fire management
- Significantly reduces the economic burden of fire suppression and land restoration
- Preserves biodiversity and ecosystem stability
- Protects vulnerable communities from fire-related disasters

## Sustainable Alignment

The project aligns directly with global sustainability frameworks, particularly:
- **UN Sustainable Development Goal 03**: Good Health and Well-being
- **UN Sustainable Development Goal 13**: Climate Action
- **UN Sustainable Development Goal 15**: Life on Land

Through early detection capabilities, I.G.N.I.S. offers a practical, scalable solution to an increasingly critical environmental challenge, demonstrating how targeted AI applications can address complex ecological problems while supporting both environmental preservation and human safety.
